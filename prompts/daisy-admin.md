                 │
                 ▼
        [archived in done.txt]
         removed from todo.txt
```

### Lifecycle Rules

1. **Completing ≠ Archiving.** `done.sh` marks a task complete (`x` prefix) but the task stays in `todo.txt`. This is intentional: completed tasks remain visible for the daily retrospective and sync validation. They are only moved to `done.txt` during `new-week.sh`.

2. **Cancelling is soft-delete.** `cancel` marks a task with `z` prefix. The task stays in `todo.txt` until the next `new-day.sh` or `new-week.sh` deletes it permanently.

3. **`done.txt` is a write-once archive.** Tasks flow into `done.txt` during weekly archival and are never modified or moved back. It exists for historical reporting (e.g., "what did I complete last quarter?").

4. **`todo.txt` always reflects current reality.** It contains active tasks, recently completed tasks (awaiting weekly archival), and cancelled tasks (awaiting cleanup). At any point, an agent can determine what the user has accomplished this week by reading completed tasks that haven't been archived yet.

### What Each Script Does and Does NOT Do

| Script | Does | Does NOT |
|--------|------|----------|
| `done.sh` | Marks task `x` in todo.txt and `[x]` in today.md, adds log entry | Move task to done.txt, remove from todo.txt |
| `new-day.sh` | Archives today.md → journal.md, deletes `z` tasks, generates new today.md | Archive completed tasks to done.txt |
| `new-week.sh` | Everything new-day does PLUS moves `x` tasks from todo.txt → done.txt | — |
| `log.sh` | Adds timestamped entry to today.md | Modify todo.txt or done.txt |

## Task Format Specification

### Active Task Format

```regex
^(\([A-D]\) )?({date_created} )({description}.*)$

Where:
  Group 1: Priority (optional): (A), (B), (C), or (D)
  Group 2: Creation date (required): YYYY-MM-DD + space
  Group 3: Description (required): Text with @context, +PROJECT, ~ALIAS labels
```

**Examples:**
```
(A) 2026-01-15 Fix critical bug @jira +PROJ-1234
(B) 2026-01-15 Review PR @git +PROJ-1236
2026-01-15 Triage this task +INBOX
(C) 2026-01-15 Standard work @context
```

### Completed Task Format

```regex
^x ({date_completed} )({date_created} )({description}.*)$

Where:
  x: Completion marker (lowercase x + space)
  Group 1: Completion date (required): YYYY-MM-DD + space
  Group 2: Creation date (required): YYYY-MM-DD + space
  Group 3: Description (required): Original description WITHOUT priority
```

**Example transformation:**
```
Before: (B) 2026-01-13 Fix bug @jira +PROJ-1234
After:  x 2026-01-15 2026-01-13 Fix bug @jira +PROJ-1234
```

**Note:** Priority is STRIPPED when marking complete. It's no longer relevant once done.

### Cancelled Task Format

```regex
^z ({date_cancelled} )({date_created} )({description}.*)$

Where:
  z: Cancellation marker (lowercase z + space)
  Group 1: Cancellation date (required): YYYY-MM-DD + space
  Group 2: Creation date (required): YYYY-MM-DD + space
  Group 3: Description (required): Original description WITHOUT priority
```

**Example transformation:**
```
Before: (C) 2026-01-14 Old task @context
After:  z 2026-01-15 2026-01-14 Old task @context
```

**Cleanup:** Cancelled tasks are automatically deleted during "new day" or "new week" workflows.

## Task Priority System - Detailed Rules

### Priority Floors (Advanced)

Tags can set minimum priority levels that cannot be demoted:

```
Priority floors (cannot demote):
- +URGENT: minimum priority A
- +OVERDUE: minimum priority B
- +TODAY: minimum priority B

Final priority = max(task priority, tag minimum priority)
```

**Examples:**
```
(C) 2026-01-15 Task +URGENT       → Treated as (A)
(D) 2026-01-15 Task +OVERDUE      → Treated as (B)
(A) 2026-01-15 Task +TODAY        → Treated as (A) (no demotion)
2026-01-15 Task +TODAY            → Treated as (B)
```

**Note:** Not yet implemented in scripts. Current scripts use explicit priority only.

### Task Extraction Rules

When extracting tasks from `todo.txt` to `today.md`:

1. **Now section:** Priority (A) tasks, excluding @git/@github
2. **Next section:** Priority (B) tasks, excluding @git/@github
3. **Inbox section:** Tasks without priority prefix, excluding @git/@github (includes default checklist items)
4. **GitHub PRs section:** ALL tasks with @git or @github context, any priority

**Special case:** Tasks with @git/@github always go to GitHub section regardless of priority.

**Task preservation:** Any incomplete task in yesterday's today.md should be preserved unless explicitly completed or cancelled. (Not yet implemented in scripts)

## Task-to-Markdown Conversion

When extracting tasks from `todo.txt` to create markdown checklist in `today.md`:

**Source format (todo.txt):**
```regex
^([xz] )?(\([A-D]\) )?({date_completed} )?({date_created} )?(.*)$

Where:
  Group 1: Completion status (x or z, optional)
  Group 2: Priority (optional)
  Group 3: Completion/cancellation date (optional)
  Group 4: Creation date (required for active tasks)
  Group 5: Body (description with labels)
```

**Target format (today.md):**
```markdown
- [ ] {contexts} {description}
- [x] {contexts} {description}  (if completed)
- [z] {contexts} {description}  (if cancelled)
```

**Conversion Steps:**
1. Parse source line using regex groups
2. Determine checkbox state:
   - Group 1 = "x " → use `- [x]`
   - Group 1 = "z " → use `- [z]`
   - Group 1 empty → use `- [ ]`
3. Drop priority (group 2)
4. Drop dates (groups 3, 4)
5. Extract body (group 5)
6. Parse body for @context labels (tokens starting with `@`)
7. Reformat: checkbox + contexts (space-separated) + remaining description

**Conversion Examples:**

| Input (todo.txt) | Output (today.md) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `(A) 2026-01-15 Fix bug @jira +PROJ-1234` | `- [ ] @jira Fix bug +PROJ-1234` |
| `x 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Fix bug @jira +PROJ-1234` | `- [x] @jira Fix bug +PROJ-1234` |
| `2026-01-15 Review PR @git +PROJ-1236` | `- [ ] @git Review PR +PROJ-1236` |
| `z 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Old task @context` | `- [z] @context Old task` |
| `(B) 2026-01-15 @git @jira Multi-context task` | `- [ ] @git @jira Multi-context task` |

**Edge cases:**
- No contexts in body → Just description (no context prefix)
- Context in middle of description → Move all contexts to front

## Task File Organization

### todo.txt Structure

```
Active tasks (top of file, grouped by priority):
(A) 2026-01-15 High priority task 1
(A) 2026-01-15 High priority task 2
(B) 2026-01-15 Next priority task 1
(B) 2026-01-15 Next priority task 2
2026-01-15 Inbox task 1 (needs triage)
2026-01-15 Inbox task 2
(C) 2026-01-15 Soon task 1
(C) 2026-01-15 Soon task 2
(D) 2026-01-15 Someday task 1

Completed tasks (end of file, before cancelled):
x 2026-01-15 2026-01-13 Completed task 1
x 2026-01-15 2026-01-14 Completed task 2

Cancelled tasks (end of file, after completed):
z 2026-01-15 2026-01-14 Cancelled task 1
z 2026-01-15 2026-01-13 Cancelled task 2
(deleted during next new day/week)
```

**Important:** Tasks should be grouped by priority, but exact ordering within a priority group is flexible.

### done.txt Structure

```
Archived completed tasks (chronological):
x 2026-01-08 2026-01-05 Old completed task 1
x 2026-01-09 2026-01-06 Old completed task 2
x 2026-01-10 2026-01-07 Old completed task 3
```

Tasks moved here during weekly archival to keep `todo.txt` focused on active work.

## Task Synchronization Rules

**`tasks/todo.txt` is the canonical source of truth for all tasks.**

### Bidirectional Sync Requirements

**ANY task change must update BOTH `todo.txt` and `today.md`:**

1. **Adding a new task:**
   - Add to `todo.txt` with priority (A/B/C/D), creation date, tags
   - Add to `today.md` if priority is (A) or (B) and working on it today

2. **Completing a task:**
   - Mark [x] in `today.md`
   - Update in `todo.txt`: strip priority, add `x YYYY-MM-DD` prefix, move to end

3. **Changing priority:**
   - Update priority (A)/(B)/(C)/(D) in `todo.txt`
   - Update section in `today.md` (Now, Next, Inbox)

4. **Changing due dates:**
   - Update `due:YYYY-MM-DD` in `todo.txt`
   - Reflect urgency in `today.md` (add **OVERDUE** flag if past due)

5. **Starting a new day:**
   - Pull high-priority (A) and (B) tasks from `todo.txt` → `today.md`
   - Archive previous `today.md` → `journal.md`

### Common Sync Issues

**Priority mismatches:**
- Task is (A) in `today.md` but (B) in `todo.txt`
- **Fix:** Update `todo.txt` to match intended priority
- **Cause:** Priority changed in one file but not the other

**Completion status mismatches:**
- Task marked [x] in `today.md` but still active in `todo.txt`
- **Fix:** Update `todo.txt` with `x YYYY-MM-DD` prefix and move to end
- **Cause:** "done" command only updated one file

**Missing tasks:**
- Task exists in `todo.txt` but not in `today.md`
- **Fix:** Usually intentional (lower priority not pulled into today)
- **Cause:** Only (A) and (B) tasks are extracted during "new day"

### Sync Validation Algorithm

**Command:** "sync tasks" or "check sync"

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Compare tasks in today.md vs todo.txt
2. For each task in today.md:
   a. Find matching task in todo.txt (by description substring)
   b. Check priority matches (section vs prefix)
   c. Check completion status matches (checkbox vs x prefix)
   d. Report discrepancies
3. Offer to synchronize automatically:
   - "Found 3 mismatches. Fix automatically?"
```

**Example Output:**
```
⚠️ Task sync issues found:

1. Priority mismatch:
   today.md: (A) Certificate training
   todo.txt: (B) Certificate training
   → Should be (A) in todo.txt

2. Completion mismatch:
   today.md: [x] PagerDuty migration
   todo.txt: (A) PagerDuty migration (still active)
   → Should be completed in todo.txt

Fix these automatically?
```

## CRITICAL: Format Preservation Rules

When modifying files, preserve EXACT formatting:

### Todo.txt Format Rules

- Active: `(PRIORITY) YYYY-MM-DD Description +Project @context`
- Completed: `x YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD Description +Project @context` (NO priority)
- Cancelled: `z YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD Description +Project @context` (NO priority)
- NEVER change date format (always `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- NEVER add/remove priority parentheses on active tasks
- NEVER preserve priority on completed/cancelled tasks
- NEVER reorder fields
- Preserve ALL spaces exactly

### Today.md Format Rules

- Preserve markdown heading levels (`####`)
- Preserve checkbox format: `- [ ]`, `- [x]`, `- [z]` (note spaces)
- NEVER add/remove blank lines between sections
- Time format: `HHMM` (24-hour, no colons)
- Log entry format: `- HHMM - message` (note dashes and spaces)

### Journal.md Archive Rules

- Append daily entries (curated/abridged during weekly review only)
- MAY be modified ONLY to:
  - Consolidate quiet days during weekly review
  - Update person references to canonical ~alias format
  - Fix chronological ordering errors
- NEVER delete stakeholder interactions or task progress
- NEVER modify retrospective content (represents historical perspective)

## Template Specifications

### journal-day.md Template

Used by `new-day.sh` to generate `today.md`:

```markdown
### {DATE} {DAY}

#### Agenda
- {TIME} Plan Day
- 1230 ...
- 1530 ...

#### Tasks

**Now:**
{HIGH_PRIORITY_TASKS}

**Next:**
{NEXT_PRIORITY_TASKS}

**Inbox:**
- [ ] Check calendar for upcoming events
- [ ] Check that todo.txt is up-to-date
- [ ] Plan day
- [ ] Retrospective
{INBOX_TASKS}

**GitHub PRs:**
{GITHUB_TASKS}

#### Log

- {TIME} New day started

#### Retrospective

* **Successes:** 
* **Misses:** 
* **What would a Sage do next:** 
```

**Placeholders:**
- `{DATE}` → YYYY-MM-DD
- `{DAY}` → Day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- `{TIME}` → HHMM in Pacific Time
- `{HIGH_PRIORITY_TASKS}` → Priority A tasks as markdown checkboxes
- `{NEXT_PRIORITY_TASKS}` → Priority B tasks as markdown checkboxes
- `{INBOX_TASKS}` → No-priority tasks as markdown checkboxes (appended after default checklist)
- `{GITHUB_TASKS}` → @git/@github tasks as markdown checkboxes

**Subsection formatting:**
- Use bold text (`**Section:**`) not headings (simplified to just "Now" and "Next")
- Preserve blank line before each subsection
- Inbox section includes default daily checklist items
- If section is empty (no extracted tasks), the placeholder is replaced with empty string

### journal-week.md Template

Used by `new-week.sh` to generate `today.md` for week start:

```markdown
#### Weekly Retrospective

* **Successes:** 
* **Misses:** 
* **What would a Sage do next:** 

---

### {DATE} {DAY}

#### Resolutions

- Who would you like to be?

#### Agenda
- {TIME} Plan Day
- 1230 ...
- 1530 ...

#### Tasks

**Now:**
{HIGH_PRIORITY_TASKS}

**Next:**
{NEXT_PRIORITY_TASKS}

**Inbox:**
- [ ] Retrospective for previous week
- [ ] Set resolutions for this week.
- [ ] Sync todo.txt with @jira and @github
- [ ] Zero Email Inboxes
- [ ] Zero Chat Notifications
- [ ] Check calendar for upcoming events
- [ ] Check that todo.txt is up-to-date
- [ ] Plan day
- [ ] Retrospective
{INBOX_TASKS}

**GitHub PRs:**
{GITHUB_TASKS}

#### Log

- {TIME} New day started

#### Retrospective

* **Successes:** 
* **Misses:** 
* **What would a Sage do next:** 
```

**Key Differences from journal-day.md:**
- Starts with "Weekly Retrospective" section at top (for previous week)
- Includes "Resolutions" section (identity-based goal setting)
- Extended inbox checklist with weekly startup items (email/chat zero-ing, JIRA/GitHub sync)
- Same task extraction logic and placeholders as daily template

## Home Management - Detailed Algorithms

### Detecting Active Home

```
1. Check $DAISY_HOME environment variable
   - If not set, error: "⚠️ DAISY_HOME not set. Add to ~/.zshenv"
2. Extract home name from $DAISY_HOME path:
   - Example: /path/to/daisy/home/work → Home: "work"
3. Verify home directory exists at $DAISY_HOME
4. Verify include.txt exists at $DAISY_HOME/include.txt
```

### System Health Check Algorithm

**Command:** "check system" or "verify setup" or "check home"

```
1. Detect active home:
   a. Check if $DAISY_HOME is set
   b. If not: Report "⚠️ No active home. Set DAISY_HOME in ~/.zshenv"
   c. Extract home name from $DAISY_HOME path

2. Verify home structure:
   a. Check if $DAISY_HOME directory exists
   b. Check if $DAISY_HOME/include.txt exists
   c. Check if $DAISY_HOME/tasks/ directory exists
   d. Check if $DAISY_HOME/journal/ directory exists
   e. Check if $DAISY_HOME/projects/ directory exists

3. Verify Required Files:
   a. Check $DAISY_HOME/tasks/todo.txt exists
   b. Check $DAISY_HOME/tasks/done.txt exists
   c. Check $DAISY_HOME/tasks/alias.txt exists
   d. Check $DAISY_HOME/journal/journal.md exists
   e. Check $DAISY_HOME/journal/today.md exists
   f. Report: ✅ or ⚠️ Missing: {path}

4. Verify Required Symlinks:
   a. Check if $DAISY_ROOT/tasks/ symlink exists and points to $DAISY_HOME/tasks/
   b. Check if $DAISY_ROOT/journal.md symlink exists and points to $DAISY_HOME/journal/journal.md
   c. Check if $DAISY_ROOT/today.md symlink exists and points to $DAISY_HOME/journal/today.md
   d. Check if $DAISY_ROOT/projects/ symlink exists and points to $DAISY_HOME/projects/
   e. Report: ✅ {link} → {target} or ⚠️ Issue with {link}

5. Validate todo.txt format (if exists):
   a. Read tasks/todo.txt
   b. For each line:
      - Skip empty lines
      - Verify matches active/completed/cancelled format
      - Check dates are YYYY-MM-DD format
      - Check priority format (A-D) if present
   c. Find format violations
   d. Report: ✅ Format valid or ⚠️ Format issues: {list}

6. Check for orphaned completed tasks:
   a. Count lines starting with "x " not at end of active section
   b. Count lines starting with "z " anywhere (should be 0 after cleanup)
   c. Report: ✅ or ℹ️ {N} completed tasks need archival

7. Verify AGENTS.md is up to date:
   a. Check if $DAISY_ROOT/AGENTS.md exists
   b. If missing: Report "⚠️ AGENTS.md not found. Run build-prompt.sh"
   c. Check modification time of AGENTS.md vs include.txt
   d. If include.txt is newer: Report "ℹ️ AGENTS.md may be stale. Run build-prompt.sh"

8. Final Report:
   ✅ Home: {name}
   ✅ All required files present
   ✅ All symlinks correct
   ✅ Todo.txt format valid
   ✅ No orphaned tasks
   ✅ AGENTS.md up to date
   
   OR
   
   ⚠️ Home: {name} - Issues found:
   - Missing files: {list}
   - Symlink issues: {list}
   - Format issues: {list}
   - Orphaned tasks: {N}
   - AGENTS.md needs rebuild
   
   Suggestions:
   - Create missing files from templates
   - Fix symlinks: See "Home Switching Algorithm"
   - Archive completed tasks: "start a new week"
   - Rebuild prompt: $DAISY_ROOT/scripts/build-prompt.sh
```

### Home Switching Algorithm

**Command:** "switch to [home]"

```
1. Detect current home:
   a. Get current $DAISY_HOME value
   b. Extract home name from path

2. Verify target home exists:
   a. Check if $DAISY_ROOT/home/{home}/ directory exists
   b. If not found, offer: "Home '{home}' not found. Create from template?"
   c. Verify $DAISY_ROOT/home/{home}/include.txt exists
   d. Verify $DAISY_ROOT/home/{home}/tasks/ exists
   e. Verify $DAISY_ROOT/home/{home}/journal/ exists

3. Update environment variable:
   a. Instruct user: "Add to ~/.zshenv: export DAISY_HOME=\"$DAISY_ROOT/home/{home}\""
   b. Instruct user: "Then run: source ~/.zshenv"

4. Update symlinks:
   a. Remove old symlinks:
      - rm $DAISY_ROOT/tasks
      - rm $DAISY_ROOT/journal.md
      - rm $DAISY_ROOT/today.md
      - rm $DAISY_ROOT/projects
   b. Create new symlinks:
      - ln -sf home/{home}/tasks tasks
      - ln -sf home/{home}/journal/journal.md journal.md
      - ln -sf home/{home}/journal/today.md today.md
      - ln -sf home/{home}/projects projects
   c. Report: "✅ Activated home: {home}"

5. Rebuild AGENTS.md:
   a. Run $DAISY_ROOT/scripts/build-prompt.sh
   b. This reads new home's include.txt and regenerates AGENTS.md
   c. Report: "✅ Built AGENTS.md for home: {home}"

6. Verify setup:
   a. Run healthcheck.sh to verify all files present
   b. If any missing, warn: "⚠️ Missing files: [list]"
   c. Offer to create missing files from templates
```

### Creating New Home Algorithm

**Command:** "create home [name]"

```
1. Check if home/{name}/ exists
   - If exists, error: "Home '{name}' already exists"

2. Copy templates/home/ to home/{name}/

3. Instruct user to customize home/{name}/include.txt:
   - List which prompts to load (one per line)
   - Common prompts: daisy, retrospective, cisco, jira, github, webex
   - Example:
     ```
     daisy
     retrospective
     github
     ```

4. Create required symlinks:
   a. ln -sf home/{name}/tasks tasks
   b. ln -sf home/{name}/journal/journal.md journal.md
   c. ln -sf home/{name}/journal/today.md today.md
   d. ln -sf home/{name}/projects projects

5. Set environment variable and build prompt:
   a. Instruct user: "export DAISY_HOME=\"$DAISY_ROOT/home/{name}\""
   b. Run $DAISY_ROOT/scripts/build-prompt.sh
   c. Report: "✅ Created home: {name}"

6. Ask: "Activate this home now?"
   - If yes, follow "Home Switching Algorithm" above
```

## Workflow Implementation Details

### Status Command Algorithm

**Command:** "status" or "daisy status"

```
1. Detect active home (check $DAISY_HOME environment variable)

2. Count tasks in todo.txt:
   a. Read tasks/todo.txt
   b. Count active tasks (not starting with "x " or "z ")
   c. Count by priority:
      - high_priority = lines starting with "(A) " or "(B) "
      - inbox = lines without priority prefix
      - soon = lines starting with "(C) "
      - someday = lines starting with "(D) "
   d. Count completed tasks this week:
      - Lines starting with "x YYYY-MM-DD" where date >= last Monday

3. Analyze today.md:
   a. Check if exists
   b. Count incomplete tasks: lines with "- [ ]"
   c. Count completed tasks: lines with "- [x]"
   d. Extract date from first heading (### YYYY-MM-DD DayName)

4. Check for overdue tasks:
   a. Parse each line in todo.txt for "due:YYYY-MM-DD"
   b. Compare to today's date
   c. If due date < today, add to overdue list

5. Run sync validation (same as sync command)
   a. Compare today.md vs todo.txt
   b. Count mismatches

6. Check journal.md:
   a. Find last date entry (### YYYY-MM-DD)
   b. Compare to today's date

7. Report formatted status:
   📊 Daisy Status ({date} {day})
   
   Home: {name}
   Tasks: {N} active ({high} high-priority, {overdue} overdue)
   Today: {incomplete} incomplete, {completed} completed
   Journal: Last entry {last_date}
   Sync: {status}
   
   [If overdue tasks exist:]
   Overdue tasks:
   - {task 1}
   - {task 2}
   
   [If sync issues exist:]
   ⚠️ Sync issues: {N} discrepancies
   Run "sync tasks" to fix
```

### Add Task Algorithm

**Command:** "add task [description]"

```
1. Parse user input:
   a. Extract description after "add task" or "new task"
   b. Identify @context labels in description
   c. Identify +PROJECT tags in description
   d. Check for due:YYYY-MM-DD
   e. Check for priority hint: "(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)" in description

2. Determine priority:
   a. If explicit priority in description, use it
   b. If no priority, ask: "Priority? (A=urgent, B=this week, C=soon, D=someday, or Enter for inbox)"
   c. Wait for user response
   d. Default to no priority (inbox) if user just presses Enter

3. Get current date as YYYY-MM-DD

4. Format for todo.txt:
   a. If priority provided: "({priority}) {date} {description}"
   b. If no priority: "{date} {description}"
   c. Preserve all @context and +PROJECT tags
   d. Preserve due:YYYY-MM-DD if present

5. Add to todo.txt:
   a. Read tasks/todo.txt
   b. Find insertion point:
      - If has priority: after last task with same priority, before next priority
      - If no priority: after all (B) tasks, before (C) tasks
   c. Insert new task at correct position
   d. Write updated todo.txt
   e. Report: "✅ Added to todo.txt: {formatted_task}"

6. Add to today.md (if high priority):
   a. If priority is (A) or (B):
      - Convert to markdown format: "- [ ] @context {description}"
      - Find appropriate section in today.md
      - Append to section
      - Report: "✅ Added to today.md: {formatted_task}"
   b. If priority is (C), (D), or none:
      - Report: "ℹ️ Low priority - not added to today.md. Will appear on next 'new day'"

7. Commit changes (call commit.sh)
```

### Change Priority Algorithm

**Command:** "priority [pattern] to [A|B|C|D]"

```
1. Parse command:
   a. Extract task pattern (substring to search)
   b. Extract target priority (A, B, C, D, or none/inbox)
   c. If target priority not specified, ask: "Change to which priority? (A/B/C/D/none)"

2. Find matching task in todo.txt:
   a. Read tasks/todo.txt
   b. Search for active tasks (not starting with "x " or "z ") matching pattern
   c. If multiple matches:
      - List all with numbers
      - Ask: "Which one? (1-N, or provide more specific pattern)"
      - Wait for user response
   d. If no match:
      - Report: "⚠️ No task found matching: {pattern}"
      - Return

3. Update todo.txt:
   a. Parse matched task: ^(\([A-D]\) )?({date} )(.*)$
   b. Extract date (group 2) and description (group 3)
   c. Remove from current position
   d. Reformat with new priority:
      - If target is A/B/C/D: "({priority}) {date} {description}"
      - If target is "none" or "inbox": "{date} {description}"
   e. Find new insertion point (among tasks with same priority)
   f. Insert task at new position
   g. Write updated todo.txt
   h. Report: "✅ Updated todo.txt: {old_priority} → {new_priority}"

4. Update today.md (if exists in today.md):
   a. Read today.md
   b. Search for matching task line (case-insensitive)
   c. If found:
      - Determine old section (Now, Next, Inbox, etc.)
      - Remove from old section
      - Determine new section based on new priority:
        * (A) → Now
        * (B) → Next
        * None → Inbox
        * (C) or (D) → Not in today.md (remove if present)
      - If new priority is (A) or (B), add to appropriate section
      - Write updated today.md
      - Report: "✅ Updated today.md: moved to {new_section}"
   d. If not found and new priority is (A) or (B):
      - Ask: "Task not in today.md. Add it now?"
      - If yes, convert to markdown and add to appropriate section
   e. If not found and priority is (C), (D), or none:
      - Report: "ℹ️ Task will appear in today.md at next 'new day'"

5. Commit changes (call commit.sh)
```

### Logging Work - Abridged Archival

**IMPORTANT:** Abridging only happens during **weekly review**, never during daily archival.

When starting a new week (step 1 of "Starting a New Week" workflow), optionally curate quiet days in journal.md:

```
Goal: Create useful historical record without verbose minutiae (ONLY during weekly review)

Preserve (never lose):
- Stakeholder interactions: "Met with ~person", "~person decided"
- Task progress: "Completed", "Blocked by", "Started"
- Discoveries: "Found", "Discovered", "Traced to"
- Decisions: "Decided to", "Chose", "Approved"
- Milestones: "Opened PR", "Merged", "Released"

Condense:
- Multiple "working on" entries → Time range + outcome
  Example: "0930, 1015, 1045 working on X" → "0930-1200 - Investigated X, found Y"
- Routine status updates → Omit if outcome is logged

Format:
- Time ranges for extended work: "0930-1200 - {activity and outcome}"
- Explicit times for events: "1130 - Met with ~person about X"
- Keep stakeholder aliases: ~person format preserved
```

**Archival Example:**

**Original today.md log:**
```
- 0930 - Started investigation of PROJ-1234
- 1015 - Still working on PROJ-1234
- 1045 - Making progress
- 1130 - Found race condition in adapter init
- 1215 - Met with ~jdoe about approach
- 1245 - Decided to use instance-based pattern
- 1445 - Implemented fix
- 1530 - PR#1545 opened
- 1545 - PR approved by ~jdoe
- 1600 - PR#1545 merged
```

**Abridged for journal.md:**
```
- 0930-1445 - Investigated PROJ-1234, found race condition in adapter init
- 1215 - Met with ~jdoe about approach, decided instance-based pattern
- 1530-1600 - PR#1545 opened, approved by ~jdoe, merged
```

## Logging - Design Rationale

### Why "If You Helped DO Something, Log It"

The original design enumerated 11 specific trigger conditions for proactive logging (stakeholder interactions, starting work, key discoveries, design decisions, etc.). In practice, agents would lose track of the list mid-conversation and forget to log.

The simplified rule -- **"if you helped the user DO something, log it"** -- is a principle rather than a checklist. It's easier to remember, harder to miss, and covers the same ground. The distinction between "doing" and "discussing" prevents over-logging while ensuring meaningful work is captured.

### Detailed Logging Triggers (Reference)

These are the specific situations that fall under the "helped DO something" rule. They are reference material for understanding intent, not a checklist for the agent to memorize:

1. **Stakeholder interactions** - User mentions meetings, discussions, decisions with colleagues
2. **Starting work** - User begins a task or asks for help with implementation
3. **Key discoveries** - Finding root causes, tracing bugs, identifying patterns
4. **Design decisions** - Choosing approaches, making architectural choices
5. **Implementations complete** - After writing/modifying code
6. **Blockers encountered** - When progress stops due to external factors
7. **Milestones reached** - PRs opened, tests passing, deployments complete
8. **Context switches** - Moving between tasks
9. **Questions raised** - Uncertainties that need resolution
10. **Technical debt identified** - Code that should be refactored or improved
11. **Learning moments** - Understanding new APIs, patterns, or legacy code

### Log Audit During Retrospective

The retrospective workflow includes a pre-step that compares completed tasks against log entries. This structural check catches logging gaps that the proactive rule missed. The audit works because:

- Completed tasks are always tracked (done.sh handles this mechanically)
- Log entries are sometimes missed (depends on agent behavior)
- The retrospective is a natural checkpoint where gaps can be filled

This creates a safety net: even if the agent forgets to log during the day, the retrospective will surface the gap before the day is archived.

## Project Management - Architecture

### Design Rationale

**Problem:** Projects have context beyond their tasks -- goals, resources, open questions, decisions, stakeholders. The `+PROJECT` tag in todo.txt captures *what to do* but not *why* or *how*. Users end up putting this context in JIRA because JIRA has structure for it, which makes JIRA the management tool rather than the communication tool.

**Solution:** Each active project gets a markdown file in `projects/`. This is where the user thinks and manages their work. JIRA becomes an export target -- a place to push curated status updates outward to the company.

**Key principle:** The project file is the source of truth for the user's understanding of a project. JIRA is the source of truth for the company's understanding.

### Directory Structure

```
home/{home}/projects/
├── {project-name}.md          # Active projects
├── {project-name}.md
└── _archive/                  # Closed projects
    └── {project-name}.md
```

A symlink at the repo root provides convenient access:
```
$DAISY_ROOT/projects/ → home/{home}/projects/
```

### Project File Specification

See `templates/project.md` for the canonical template. Key sections:

| Section | Purpose | When Updated |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Header (tag, JIRA, status, goal) | Quick reference metadata | On creation, on close |
| Context | Why the project exists, what problem it solves | On creation, rarely changed |
| Outcomes | Measurable deliverables (checkboxes) | On creation, marked complete as achieved |
| Resources | Links to docs, code, people | Throughout project lifecycle |
| Decisions | Timestamped record of choices made and why | When decisions happen |
| Open Questions | Unresolved uncertainties | Added/removed throughout |
| Notes | Freeform thinking, research, observations | Throughout project lifecycle |

### Project-Task Linking

Projects and tasks are linked bidirectionally through the `+PROJECT` tag:

- **Tasks → Project:** Tasks in todo.txt carry `+project-name` tags
- **Project → Tasks:** The project file's `Tag` field identifies which todo.txt tasks belong to it
- **Aggregation:** The "project status" command pulls all tasks with the matching tag

### Start Project Algorithm

```
1. Parse project name from user input
2. Check if projects/{name}.md already exists
   - If exists: "Project '{name}' already exists. Open it?"
3. Copy templates/project.md to projects/{name}.md
4. Fill in known details:
   a. Tag: +{name} (kebab-case)
   b. JIRA: ticket key if mentioned
   c. Status: active
   d. Started: today's date
   e. Goal: from conversation context
5. Ask: "Would you like to create initial tasks for this project?"
   - If yes, walk through adding tasks with +{name} tag
6. Commit: "New project: {name}"
```

### Project Status Algorithm

```
1. Read projects/{name}.md
2. Search todo.txt for all lines containing +{name}:
   a. Count active tasks (no x/z prefix)
   b. Count completed tasks (x prefix)
   c. Count cancelled tasks (z prefix)
3. Search today.md log for entries mentioning +{name} or project name
4. Extract open questions from project file
5. Report:
   - Project metadata (status, goal)
   - Task summary (active/completed/blocked)
   - Recent activity from logs
   - Open questions
   - Unresolved decisions
```

### Close Project Algorithm

```
1. Read projects/{name}.md
2. Review outcomes:
   a. For each outcome checkbox, confirm complete or incomplete
   b. Add completion notes
3. Add closing section:
   - Closed: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Final status: completed | abandoned | superseded
   - Summary: one-paragraph retrospective
4. Create projects/_archive/ if it doesn't exist
5. Move file: projects/{name}.md → projects/_archive/{name}.md
6. Handle remaining tasks:
   a. Find active tasks with +{name} in todo.txt
   b. For each: ask "Cancel, reassign to another project, or keep?"
7. Commit: "Closed project: {name}"
```

### JIRA Sync Algorithm

```
1. Read projects/{name}.md
2. Extract JIRA ticket key from header
3. Draft JIRA-appropriate summary:
   a. Current status (one line)
   b. Recent progress (bullet points, professional tone)
   c. Blockers or risks (if any)
   d. Next steps
4. Present draft to user for approval
5. Post as JIRA comment via MCP tools or API
6. Optionally update JIRA ticket status field
7. Log: "Synced project {name} status to JIRA {ticket}"
```

## Reference - Validation After Modifications

After modifying any file, verify:

### Todo.txt Validation

- All active tasks: `(P) YYYY-MM-DD Description` or `YYYY-MM-DD Description`
- All completed tasks: `x YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD Description` (no priority)
- All cancelled tasks: `z YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD Description` (no priority)
- Completed tasks before cancelled at end of file
- No duplicate lines
- All dates are YYYY-MM-DD format

### Today.md Validation

- All markdown headings preserved (####)
- Checkbox format correct: `- [ ]`, `- [x]`, `- [z]`
- Log entries format: `- HHMM - message`
- No extra blank lines added
- All sections present

### Journal.md Validation

- Entries in chronological order (oldest first)
- Stakeholder interactions preserved
- Task progress documented
- Proper blank line separation between entries

## Reference - Cross-File Consistency

When completing a task, ensure:
1. today.md checkbox changes `[ ]` → `[x]`
2. tasks/todo.txt gets `x YYYY-MM-DD` prefix
3. Priority STRIPPED from completed task
4. Completed task moves to END of todo.txt
5. Log entry added documenting completion
6. No other changes to either file

When referencing people:
1. Always use `~alias` from tasks/alias.txt
2. NEVER use bare names or emails
3. Check alias.txt if unsure

## Reference - Timestamps

- Use 24-hour format: `1430` not `2:30 PM`
- No colons in times: `1430` not `14:30`
- Default to Pacific Time unless specified otherwise
- When converting: explicitly note "converted to Pacific Time"

## Script Implementation Notes

Current scripts (`new-day.sh`, `new-week.sh`, `done.sh`, `log.sh`) implement basic workflows but do NOT yet implement:

- Priority floor rules (+URGENT, +OVERDUE, +TODAY)
- Task preservation from yesterday's today.md
- Quiet day consolidation
- Advanced sync validation
- Project management commands (start/status/update/close project)
- JIRA sync from project files
- Log audit during retrospective

These features are documented here for future implementation. Project workflows and log auditing are currently handled by the agent following prompt instructions rather than dedicated scripts.

**Implemented scripts:**

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `new-day.sh` | Archive yesterday, generate new today.md |
| `new-week.sh` | Archive completed tasks to done.txt + new day |
| `done.sh` | Mark task complete in todo.txt and today.md |
| `log.sh` | Add timestamped log entry to today.md |
| `switch-home.sh` | Update symlinks and rebuild AGENTS.md for a different home |
| `create-home.sh` | Create new home from template, optionally activate |
| `build-prompt.sh` | Generate AGENTS.md from include.txt (supports lazy loading) |

## AGENTS.md Build System

### Lazy Loading Architecture

To keep `AGENTS.md` small and save tokens, prompts can be included in two modes:

**Full inclusion** (default): The entire prompt file is embedded in `AGENTS.md`. Used for core prompts that are always needed (e.g., `daisy`).

**Lazy inclusion** (`~` prefix in `include.txt`): Only the `## Trigger` section from the prompt file is embedded. The trigger section tells the agent when to read the full prompt on demand.

### include.txt Format

```
# Full inclusion (entire file in AGENTS.md)
daisy

# Lazy inclusion (trigger only, full file read on demand)
~retrospective
~github
```

### Adding a ## Trigger Section to a Prompt

Every lazy-loaded prompt must start with a `## Trigger` section before any other heading:

```markdown
## Trigger

Read the full `daisy/prompts/{name}.md` when:
- {condition 1}
- {condition 2}
- {condition 3}

# {Prompt Title}
...rest of prompt...
```

The `build-prompt.sh` script extracts everything between `## Trigger` and the next heading (`#` or `##`). If no `## Trigger` section is found, the prompt falls back to full inclusion with a warning.

### Token Budget

With lazy loading, the work home `AGENTS.md` is approximately:
- **~500 lines** (trigger-only mode) vs **~1700 lines** (all-full mode)
- ~70% reduction in tokens per session
- Full prompt files are only loaded when their trigger conditions match
