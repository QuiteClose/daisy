# Daisy Productivity System

This workspace uses the **daisy** personal productivity system for task management, journaling, and logging.

When the user addresses **"Daisy"** by name (e.g., "Daisy, start a new day", "Please log that, Daisy"), they are invoking this system. **Read `daisy/AGENTS.md`** to understand and execute the request.

Also read `daisy/AGENTS.md` for any of these actions, even without the "Daisy" address:
- Starting a new day or week
- Managing tasks (adding, completing, cancelling, reprioritizing)
- Logging work or interactions
- Working with projects
- Performing retrospectives
- Checking system status or syncing tasks

The daisy system is located at `daisy/` in this workspace (symlinked to the shared daisy repo).
