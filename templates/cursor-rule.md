# Daisy Productivity System

This workspace uses the **daisy** personal productivity system for task management, journaling, and logging.

**Read `daisy/AGENTS.md`** before performing any of these actions:
- Starting a new day or week
- Managing tasks (adding, completing, cancelling, reprioritizing)
- Logging work or interactions
- Working with projects
- Performing retrospectives
- Checking system status or syncing tasks

The daisy system is located at `daisy/` in this workspace (symlinked to the shared daisy repo).
