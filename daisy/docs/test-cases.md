# Daisy Validation Test Cases

This document contains test cases for validating AI behavior in the daisy system. Use these to verify workflows produce expected outputs.

## Test Case 1: Starting a New Day

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(A) 2026-01-15 Fix critical bug @jira +PROJ-1234
(B) 2026-01-15 Review design doc @jira +PROJ-1235
(B) 2026-01-15 Sprint planning @meeting
2026-01-15 Triage new tickets +INBOX
2026-01-15 Update documentation @jira +PROJ-1236
(B) 2026-01-15 Review PR#1234 @git +PROJ-1237
(C) 2026-01-15 Refactor utils module @jira
x 2026-01-15 2026-01-10 Old completed task @jira
```

### Command
```
start a new day
```

### Expected Output

**today.md sections should contain:**

```markdown
#### High-Priority Tasks
- [ ] @jira Fix critical bug +PROJ-1234
- [ ] @jira Review design doc +PROJ-1235
- [ ] @meeting Sprint planning

#### Task Inbox
- [ ] Triage new tickets +INBOX
- [ ] @jira Update documentation +PROJ-1236

#### GitHub PRs
- [ ] @git Review PR#1234 +PROJ-1237
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ (A) and (B) tasks in High-Priority (excluding @git)
- ✅ Tasks without priority in Task Inbox (excluding @git)
- ✅ @git/@github tasks in separate section regardless of priority
- ✅ (C) priority task NOT included (not high-priority)
- ✅ Completed tasks (x prefix) NOT included

---

## Test Case 2: Completing a Task

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 Fix critical bug @jira +PROJ-1234
(B) 2026-01-16 Review design doc @jira
```

**today.md excerpt:**
```markdown
#### High-Priority Tasks
- [ ] @jira Fix critical bug +PROJ-1234
- [ ] @jira Review design doc
```

### Command
```
done bug fix
```

### Expected Output

**today.md after:**
```markdown
#### High-Priority Tasks
- [x] @jira Fix critical bug +PROJ-1234
- [ ] @jira Review design doc
```

**tasks/todo.txt after:**
```
(B) 2026-01-16 Review design doc @jira
x 2026-01-16 2026-01-16 Fix critical bug @jira +PROJ-1234
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Checkbox changed `[ ]` → `[x]` in today.md
- ✅ Task moved to end of todo.txt
- ✅ Priority STRIPPED from completed task
- ✅ Completion date added (first date)
- ✅ Creation date preserved (second date)
- ✅ Description unchanged
- ✅ Exactly one commit, containing both file edits
- ✅ Exactly one line of stdout: `✅ Done: {description} (commit {hash})` —
  no `Logged:`/`Committed:`/`No changes to commit` chatter from the `daisy
  log`/`daisy commit` sub-calls it makes internally
- ✅ Matching is case-insensitive literal substring, not regex — `.`, `*`,
  `[`, `/` in the pattern match themselves

**If the description is absent from today.md** (e.g. an Inbox-only item):
todo.txt still completes, a warning is printed on stderr, and the run still
exits 0 and commits.

---

## Test Case 3: Cancelling a Task

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(B) 2026-01-16 Old task @jira
(C) 2026-01-16 Another task @jira
```

### Command
```
cancel old task
```

### Expected Output

**tasks/todo.txt after:**
```
(C) 2026-01-16 Another task @jira
z 2026-01-16 2026-01-16 Old task @jira
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Task marked with `z` prefix
- ✅ Priority STRIPPED
- ✅ Moved to end (after completed tasks if any)
- ✅ Format: `z {cancellation_date} {creation_date} {description}`

---

## Test Case 4: New Day with Cancelled Tasks

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 Important task @jira
z 2026-01-15 2026-01-14 Old cancelled task 1
z 2026-01-15 2026-01-13 Old cancelled task 2
```

### Command
```
start a new day
```

### Expected Output

**tasks/todo.txt after:**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 Important task @jira
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ All lines starting with `z ` removed
- ✅ Active tasks preserved
- ✅ Report: "🗑️ Deleted 2 cancelled tasks"

---

## Test Case 5: Starting a New Week

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**

(B) 2026-01-20 Another new task @jira
x 2026-01-19 2026-01-15 Completed task 1 @jira
x 2026-01-18 2026-01-14 Completed task 2 @jira
x 2026-01-17 2026-01-13 Completed task 3 @jira
z 2026-01-19 2026-01-16 Cancelled task
```

**tasks/done.txt (before):**
```
x 2026-01-10 2026-01-05 Old completed task @jira
```

### Command
```
start a new week
```

### Expected Output

**tasks/todo.txt after:**
```
(A) 2026-01-20 New priority task @jira
(B) 2026-01-20 Another new task @jira
```

**tasks/done.txt after:**
```
x 2026-01-10 2026-01-05 Old completed task @jira
x 2026-01-19 2026-01-15 Completed task 1 @jira
x 2026-01-18 2026-01-14 Completed task 2 @jira
x 2026-01-17 2026-01-13 Completed task 3 @jira
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Cancelled tasks deleted
- ✅ Completed tasks moved to done.txt
- ✅ Active tasks remain in todo.txt
- ✅ done.txt preserves existing entries
- ✅ Report: "🗑️ Deleted 1 cancelled task"
- ✅ Report: "📦 Archived 3 completed tasks"

## Test Case 6: Task-to-Markdown Conversion

### Input (todo.txt lines)

| Input | Expected Output (today.md) |
|-------|---------------------------|
| `(A) 2026-01-15 Fix bug @jira +PROJ-1234` | `- [ ] @jira Fix bug +PROJ-1234` |
| `x 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Fix bug @jira +PROJ-1234` | `- [x] @jira Fix bug +PROJ-1234` |
| `2026-01-15 Review PR @git +PROJ-1236` | `- [ ] @git Review PR +PROJ-1236` |
| `z 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Old task @context` | `- [z] @context Old task` |
| `(B) 2026-01-15 @git @jira Multi-context task` | `- [ ] @git @jira Multi-context task` |
| `(C) 2026-01-15 No context task +PROJECT` | `- [ ] No context task +PROJECT` |

**Verification Rules:**
- ✅ Priority stripped
- ✅ Dates stripped
- ✅ @context labels moved to front
- ✅ Checkbox state matches completion status (x/z/none)
- ✅ +PROJECT labels preserved in position
- ✅ Description preserved exactly

## Test Case 8: System Health Check

### Setup

**Symlinks (correct):**
```
prompt.md → home/work/prompt.md
tasks → home/work/tasks
journal.md → home/work/journal/journal.md
today.md → home/work/journal/today.md
```

**Files (all exist):**
```
home/work/prompt.md
home/work/tasks/todo.txt
home/work/tasks/done.txt
home/work/tasks/alias.txt
home/work/journal/journal.md
home/work/journal/today.md
```

**tasks/todo.txt (valid format):**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 Valid task @jira
2026-01-16 Valid inbox task
x 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Valid completed task
```

### Command
```
check system
```

### Expected Output

```
✅ System Health Check

Home: work
Required Files: ✅ All 6 files present
Symlinks:
  ✅ prompt.md → home/work/prompt.md
  ✅ tasks → home/work/tasks
  ✅ journal.md → home/work/journal/journal.md
  ✅ today.md → home/work/journal/today.md
Format: ✅ todo.txt format valid (3 tasks)
Status: ✅ System healthy
```

---

## Test Case 9: System Health Check (Issues)

### Setup

**Symlinks (broken):**
```
prompt.md → home/work/prompt.md (exists)
tasks → home/work/tasks (exists)
journal.md → MISSING
today.md → home/work/journal/today.md (target missing)
```

**Missing files:**
```
home/work/journal/journal.md (missing)
home/work/journal/today.md (missing)
```

**tasks/todo.txt (invalid format):**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 Valid task @jira
INVALID LINE NO DATE
x 2026-13-99 2026-01-15 Invalid date format
```

### Command
```
check system
```

### Expected Output

```
⚠️ System Health Check

Home: work
Required Files: ⚠️ 2 of 6 files missing
  ⚠️ Missing: home/work/journal/journal.md
  ⚠️ Missing: home/work/journal/today.md

Symlinks:
  ✅ prompt.md → home/work/prompt.md
  ✅ tasks → home/work/tasks
  ⚠️ journal.md → symlink missing
  ⚠️ today.md → target file missing

Format: ⚠️ 2 format issues in todo.txt
  Line 2: Missing date
  Line 3: Invalid date format

Status: ⚠️ System needs attention

Suggestions:
- Create missing files from templates
- Re-run home setup: "switch to work"
- Fix format issues in todo.txt
```

## Test Case 10: Home Switching

### Setup

**Current state:**
```
Active home: work
Symlinks point to home/work/*
```

**Target:**
```
home/personal/prompt.md exists
home/personal/tasks/ exists
home/personal/journal/ exists
```

### Command
```
switch to personal
```

### Expected Process

1. **Detect current:** Parse prompt.md → "work"
2. **Teardown:** Remove 4 symlinks (prompt.md, tasks, journal.md, today.md)
3. **Verify target:** Check home/personal/prompt.md exists
4. **Setup:** Create 4 new symlinks to home/personal/*
5. **Verify:** Check all required files exist

### Expected Output

```
Deactivated home: work
✅ Activated home: personal

Verified files:
  ✅ tasks/todo.txt
  ✅ tasks/done.txt
  ✅ tasks/alias.txt
  ✅ journal/journal.md
  ✅ journal/today.md
  ✅ prompt.md

All systems ready!
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Old symlinks removed
- ✅ New symlinks created
- ✅ Symlinks point to home/personal/*
- ✅ All files verified
- ✅ No files deleted (only symlinks changed)

## Test Case 11: Pattern Matching (Disambiguation)

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 Fix bug in adapter module @jira
(A) 2026-01-16 Fix bug in utils module @jira
(B) 2026-01-16 Review design doc @jira
```

### Command
```
done bug
```

### Expected Behavior

`done.sh` refuses outright — it does not guess or wait interactively, since
resolution and disambiguation both happen inside the script, not the agent:

```
Multiple tasks match "bug":
  1) (A) 2026-01-16 Fix bug in adapter module @jira
  2) (A) 2026-01-16 Fix bug in utils module @jira
```

- Exit code: non-zero
- **todo.txt and today.md are untouched** — no partial completion, no commit
- The agent relays the numbered candidates to the user, then re-runs `done`
  with a more specific pattern (e.g. `done adapter`), which resolves to
  exactly one match and completes normally

**Verification:**
- ✅ Both matching tasks listed, numbered
- ✅ Non-zero exit — an agent trusting the exit code will not report success
- ✅ No file touched on refusal
- ✅ A more specific pattern on retry resolves and completes

---

## Test Case 12: Priority Extraction Edge Cases

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(A) 2026-01-16 High priority normal task @jira
(B) 2026-01-16 High priority git task @git
2026-01-16 Inbox normal task @jira
2026-01-16 Inbox git task @github
(C) 2026-01-16 Soon normal task @jira
(C) 2026-01-16 Soon git task @git
x 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Completed task @jira
z 2026-01-16 2026-01-15 Cancelled task @jira
```

### Command
```
start a new day
```

### Expected today.md Sections

**High-Priority Tasks:**
```
- [ ] @jira High priority normal task
```

**Task Inbox:**
```
- [ ] @jira Inbox normal task
```

**GitHub PRs:**
```
- [ ] @git High priority git task
- [ ] @github Inbox git task
- [ ] @git Soon git task
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ (A) non-git → High-Priority
- ✅ (B) with @git → GitHub PRs (NOT High-Priority)
- ✅ No priority, no git → Task Inbox
- ✅ No priority, with @github → GitHub PRs
- ✅ (C) with @git → GitHub PRs
- ✅ x and z tasks EXCLUDED from all sections

## Test Case 13: Aggregating a Project's Tasks

### Setup

**tasks/todo.txt:**
```
(B) 2026-01-16 Design the schema +widgets
x 2026-01-15 2026-01-10 Draft the proposal +widgets
(C) 2026-01-16 Unrelated task +other
```

**tasks/done.txt:**
```
x 2026-01-05 2026-01-01 Kickoff meeting +widgets
```

### Command
```
daisy tasks --all +widgets
```

### Expected Output

```
(B) 2026-01-16 Design the schema +widgets
x 2026-01-15 2026-01-10 Draft the proposal +widgets
x 2026-01-05 2026-01-01 Kickoff meeting +widgets
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Bare lines only — no header, no summary count, no decoration
- ✅ `+other` excluded — literal substring match on `+widgets`, not a
  looser tag match
- ✅ Both todo.txt (active + not-yet-rotated completed) and done.txt lines
  present under `--all`
- ✅ Read-only: todo.txt and done.txt are byte-identical after the command,
  and no commit is produced
- ✅ No pattern given → every line of the selected file(s)
- ✅ No matches → nothing on stdout, non-zero exit (grep convention)
