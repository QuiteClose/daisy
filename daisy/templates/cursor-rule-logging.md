# Daisy Logging Post-Hook

After completing any action that changes files, runs commands, or produces an outcome (not just discussion), log it via:

```bash
$DAISY_ROOT/daisy/scripts/log.sh "concise description of what was done"
```

See `.daisy/AGENTS.md` for log format guidelines (HHMM timestamps, ~aliases, +PROJECT tags, chronological order).

Do not log pure Q&A or code exploration without an outcome.
